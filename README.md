# FateVC 
Discord Voice Chat Exploit

# How does this work?
Discord Voice Channels has multiple server regions that lets people around the world connect from their specific region to one big huge server connecting other people in the same voice call hub.
This while good can have its downsides especially when you give users the ability to swap between the servers as much as they please. Changing the Region of a call is usually handled server-side as it changes not only for one person but everyone else.
So I decided that if this was the case then by making a simple loop that utilizes the api functions that specifically control the region of a vc, which in turn will instantly take down the voice call.

#Does this still work?
This does work...to a degree. I decided to run some tests on the different areas that this can be used and came to find out that this doesnt work for Discord Servers. I plan to eventually run this test on private Discord VCs
